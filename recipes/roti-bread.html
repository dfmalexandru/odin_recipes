<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A an unleavened griddle bread from India which is similar to pita bread. It is also known as roti. Ideally, I use the traditional Indian roti griddle called a 'tava.'</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        2 cups durum wheat flour
    </li>
    <li>
        ½ teaspoon salt
    </li>
    <li>
        ¾ cup water
    </li>
    <li>
        1 tablespoon vegetable oil
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, salt, water and oil, until the mixture pulls away from the sides. Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface. Knead until smooth and pliable, about 10 minutes.</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Preheat an unoiled skillet or tava to medium high heat. Divide dough into 12 equal parts, form into rounds and cover with a damp cloth. Flatten the balls with the palm of your hand, then use a rolling pin to roll out each piece into a 6 to 8 inch diameter
    round.</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cook the roti for 1 minute before turning over, then turn again after another minute. The roti should have some darker brown spots when finished. Best served warm.</p>
